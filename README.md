# typewriter-scroll

Typewriter scroll keeps the cursor in the middle of the buffer as you type, imitating the typewriter.

## Usage

Toggle the typewriter mode with `ctrl+alt+t`. "Scroll past end" option must be enabled in the settings for this to work.

## Credits

The code is heavily based on [Zen](https://github.com/defunkt/Zen) by Chris Wanstrath.
